Hello and welcome to my site. I am a graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a bachelors degree in Mathematics. I am currently an aspiring data scientist working to apply my math knowledge to the world of data.

This site will serve as a portfolio for all of my work, under each of the tabs you will see a collection of my work that includes coursework that I have done, any online assignments I have found particularly interesting, or any personal projects I have undertaken. 

My current interests mathematically lie within Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and I am in the midst of reading the PDE text by Lawrence C. Evans. My interests in data are within neural networks. I have been working on making a pokemon recognition neural network tool. My interests in physics are currently on stellar bodies or many sorts of astrophysical topics.
