This page is where I will be documenting my coursework for the various math courses I took during my time during Georgia Tech. This is not an exhaustive list of all of the courses I took or the courses I did because for some I do not have adequate documentation that I feel should be required for me to present here on this page.

The coursework found here is the most up to date version that I had submitted to my professors during my time. I do not claim that all the solutions that are found here are 100% accurate. In fact, I know that there are some incorrect solutions here, but I present them "as is," as a completed body of work. I do desire to slowly work back over my work over time and fix many of the mistakes that I had made, but this is a project that sits on the back-burner and may not get done for a while.

Additionally, after the coursework presentations, I will list any additional reading or work that I have done that I wish to present as it happens.

## MATH 3235: Probability Theory
