This page is where I will be documenting my coursework for the various computer science courses I took during my time at Georgia Tech. While this isn't an exhaustive list of all the courses I took, these are some of my favorites and would like to present my work.

The coursework found here is the most up to date version that I had submitted to my professors during my time. I do not claim that all the solutions that are found here are 100% accurate. In fact, I know that there are some incorrect solutions here, but I present them "as is," as a completed body of work. While there are incorrect solutions here, I endeavor to, overtime, go back and fix the mistakes I made now that I have a better understanding of the topics.

Additionally, after the coursework presentations, I will list any additional reading or work that I have done that I wish to present.

Currently, my interests are in mathematical applications of coding and computer science and networking.

## CS 3510: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Course Description: The course covers basic techniques (such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, local search) for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for standard computational problems (related to graphs, hashing, sorting, optimization, etc). It also provides an introduction to the theory of NP-Completeness.
