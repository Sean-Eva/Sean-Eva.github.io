This page is where I will document my work as it relates to data, data analysis, or data science. On this page I am going to show off my projects that I have been working on over time as well as any data related certifications I receive.

Currently my projects are mostly in the realm of data capturing, cleaning, analyzing, and presentation. I endeavor to soon add more projects in the realm of AI and machine learning or data science more generally.

Currently, my interests are in neural networks and their applications.
